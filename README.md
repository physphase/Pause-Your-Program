Tool to decrease PC power usage when afk by suspending a single program with a keybind.

for Nvidia: check gpu usage by using the command "nvidia-smi". This shows GPU power usage and the load percentage.
for AMD: Try checking the GPU utilization by using the commands "amdconfig --odgc" and "amdconfig --odgt". I do not have an AMD graphics card, so I could not test these commands.
